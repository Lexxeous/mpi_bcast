The custom and default broadcast implementations are equivalent.

The original broadcast array (org_Bcast_arr[]) was allocated and initialized with random double values in 0.004794 seconds.
The array was broadcasted to all other processes using "custom_Bcast()" in 0.001386 seconds.
The array was broadcasted to all other processes using "MPI_Bcast()" in 0.000546 seconds.

Number of nodes:
SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES = 1.
Tasks per node:
SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE = 8.
