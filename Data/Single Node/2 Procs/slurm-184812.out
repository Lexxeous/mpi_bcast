1 : Default MPI broadcast array[0 1 ... 99998 99999] = [0 0 ... 0 0]

The custom and default broadcast implementations are equivalent.

The original broadcast array (org_Bcast_arr[]) was allocated and initialized with random double values in 0.004353 seconds.
The array was broadcasted to all other processes using "custom_Bcast()" in 0.000302 seconds.
The array was broadcasted to all other processes using "MPI_Bcast()" in 0.000155 seconds.

Number of nodes:
SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES = 1.
Tasks per node:
SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE = 2.
