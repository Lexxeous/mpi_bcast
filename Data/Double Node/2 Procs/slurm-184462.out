Comparing the execution time between the default library version of "MPI_Bcast()" and a custom implementation using only point-to-point communication...

0 : Original broadcast array[0 1 ... 99998 99999] = [0 0 ... 0 0]
0 : Initialized custom broadcast array[0 1 ... 99998 99999] = [-1 -1 ... -1 -1]

0 : Default MPI broadcast array[0 1 ... 99998 99999] = [1.13759e+308 6.5641e+307 ... 1.31069e+308 1.12595e+308]
1 : Default MPI broadcast array[0 1 ... 99998 99999] = [0 0 ... 0 0]

The custom and default broadcast implementations are equivalent.

The original broadcast array (org_Bcast_arr[]) was allocated and initialized with random double values in 0.026039 seconds.
The array was broadcasted to all other processes using "custom_Bcast()" in 0.000565 seconds.
The array was broadcasted to all other processes using "MPI_Bcast()" in 0.000238 seconds.

Number of nodes:
SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES = 2.
Tasks per node:
SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE = 1.
