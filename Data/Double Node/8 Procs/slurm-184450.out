The custom and default broadcast implementations are equivalent.

The original broadcast array (org_Bcast_arr[]) was allocated and initialized with random double values in 0.35596 seconds.
The array was broadcasted to all other processes using "custom_Bcast()" in 0.717812 seconds.
The array was broadcasted to all other processes using "MPI_Bcast()" in 0.025128 seconds.
